## 🌍 Key Parameters for Sustainability Score

The sustainability score is calculated using weighted parameters that consider the environmental impact of each product. These parameters are:

1. **🌱 Overall Sustainability Score**: Quick summary rating (0-100%) for decision-making.
2. **🌍 Carbon Footprint**: CO₂ emissions during production.
3. **🚰 Water Usage**: Liters of water consumed for production.
4. **🏭 Manufacturing Impact**: Pollution, deforestation, or waste generated.
5. **🔄 Recyclability**: Percentage of product that can be recycled.
6. **✅ Eco Certifications**: Fair Trade, FSC, Energy Star, etc.
7. **🛢️ Harmful Chemicals Used**: Toxic materials like microplastics and heavy metals.
8. **🌾 Material Composition**: Organic, recycled, synthetic materials used.
9. **🔥 Biodegradability**: Time taken to decompose.
10. **✈️ Shipping Impact**: Distance traveled & CO₂ emissions from transportation.

### Example Calculation for a Product

For example, a product like an **Eco-friendly Bluetooth Speaker** will have a sustainability score calculated based on the weighted sum of individual scores for each parameter.
